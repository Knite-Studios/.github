# Welcome to Smooth Brain!

Knite Studios・Skill Issue.
Hey there! You've stumbled upon Smooth Brain. Who are we? Just a bunch of ambitious industry professionals who decided it'd be cool to come together, brainstorm the wildest ideas, and bring them to life without involving all the weird predatory monetization into the mix. Keep games fun, old-school style. You buy once, enjoy forever. Yep, good ol' gaming without trying to squeeze the player for everything they are worth!

## Prioritizing creating lasting memories Over Earning 

We’re here to mess around with code, push some pixels, and maybe - just maybe - learn a thing or two in the process. And hey, while we're at it, we're beefing up our portfolios. But more importantly: we aren't planning on overly monetizing it, the aim is affordable games with content updates and DLCs for free. We invest in our player base in hopes that our transparency keeps them returning to support our next project! All our stuff? Consider it our love letter to the world of game developement and a big ‘thank you’ note to caffeine.
