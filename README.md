# Welcome to Knite Studios!

Knite Studiosãƒ»Embracing Crazy
Hey there! You've stumbled upon Knite Studios. Who are we? Just a bunch of ambitious industry professional who decided it'd be cool to come together, brainstorm the wildest ideas, and actually bring them to life. Yep, weâ€™re all about experimenting with our skill cielings and pushing ourselves to the limit!

## Learning Over Earning: 

Weâ€™re here to mess around with code, push some pixels, and maybe - just maybe - learn a thing or two in the process. And hey, while we're at it, we're beefing up our portfolios. But more importantly: we aren't planning on monetizing it. All our stuff? Consider it our love letter to the world of gaming and a big â€˜thank youâ€™ note to caffeine.
